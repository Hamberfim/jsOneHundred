### Javascript Projects Site Template

A javascript coding exercise. A program that displays a range of numbers with even numbers in bold.<br><br>
Using HTML, custom CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript we can design an application that can take user input (starting value and ending value), generate and display a count of the resulting range of numbers and denote the even numbers in <span class="fw-bold">bold</span>.
